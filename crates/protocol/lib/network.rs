//! Host ↔ host protocol messages for runtime port-forwarding events.
//!
//! These messages travel guest-side → relay → SDK over the same
//! agent.sock framing the exec/fs traffic uses. They are emitted by
//! the host-side smoltcp `PortPublisher` (not by agentd in the
//! guest) — the relay's host-local dispatch path injects them into
//! the outbound frame stream so subscribed SDK clients see them as
//! pushed events on a reserved correlation ID.
//!
//! Today only `PortEvent` exists; the design leaves room for the
//! reverse direction (SDK→host `PortAddRequest`/`PortRemoveRequest`)
//! when explicit declarative `--publish` migrates onto the same
//! channel.
